## Goal 

The following are the goal(s) set out for this project.

1. Allow developers to query REST API with minimal yet essential data and get back a **view** of the following:
   - The network(s) the provider belongs to
   - The locations of where the provider practices
   - The organizations the provider is linked
2. Allow developers to query the endpoint free of charge.
   - If funding to cover server cost isn't available feel free to fork repository and deploy üëç. Please configure correctly as stated in README.md (You will need to register your app with the companies)
3. Provide comprehensive documentation to facilitate transparency & use of the REST API.
